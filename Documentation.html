      <p>The interactive graph “Top 300 Video Games” is designed to be able to look at many different aspects of the dataset. It’s a scatter plot graph that looks at the difference in sales in the north America and how they compare to the global sales. The games are grouped together by genre in which you can choose to view or remove specific genres from the graph. To learn more about a specific data point, hover the mouse over the point and specific information such as name of the game and consol will appear. </p>

      <p>The first step in my design process was finding the right dataset and build ideas from there. I had first wanted to create a bar chart race, but quickly discovered the difficulty it would be along with the fact I would have been able to use most of my dataset. I first created the scatterplot, and as I worked a continued to add more interactive features. The checkboxes for genres were the first interactive feature I added. It was then that the use of separating the data by genre came to be. I had run into an issue that some of the points are hard to see as scatterplot tend to cluster. To fix this, when checkboxes are checked or unchecked the axis will change scale to allow for easy readability.  In the scatterplot you can observe a wide range of colors. Each color represents a specific genre. The colors are bright and easy to see while not overpowering with saturation. </p>

      <p>At first glance we can see that most of the data points are clustered in a small area. With the use of the checkboxes, we can single out a specific genre, or compare two or more against each other. When using the checkboxes, the scale will automatically shift to fit the current data checked, zooming in closer or zooming out.          </p>

      <p>In this screenshot here we have the graph filtered to look at the puzzle genre. We can see that Tetris (the most popular one) had NA sale make up most of the global sales. So, Tetris is more commonly bought and played in north America. </p>

      <p>Here we can compare two genres against each other. In orange we have Role-Playing, and in blue Simulation. There are more games in the top 300 which fall into the role-playing genre. The datapoint being highlighted is a popular Pokémon game for the DS. It appears that this game is not as popular in north America than elsewhere in the world.</p>

      <p>There are many different aspects and tools to use to analyze this graph. For a walkthrough of the graph check out the video below:</p>
