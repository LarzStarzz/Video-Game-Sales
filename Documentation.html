      <h1>Welcome to the Documentation Page</h1>
      <p>The interactive graph “Top 300 Video Games” is designed to be able to look at many different aspects of the dataset. 
        It’s a scatter plot graph that looks at the difference in sales in the north America and how they compare to the global 
        sales. The games are grouped together by genre in which you can choose to view or remove specific genres from the
        graph. To learn more about a specific data point, hover the mouse over the point and specific information such 
        as name of the game and consol will appear. </p>

      <p>The first step in my design process was finding the right dataset and build ideas from there. I had first wanted 
        to create a bar chart race, but quickly discovered the difficulty it would be along with the fact I would have 
        been able to use most of my dataset. I first created the scatterplot, and as I worked a continued to add more 
        interactive features. The checkboxes for genres were the first interactive feature I added. It was then that the 
        use of separating the data by genre came to be. I had run into an issue that some of the points are hard to see 
        as scatterplot tend to cluster. To fix this, when checkboxes are checked or unchecked the axis will change scale 
        to allow for easy readability.  In the scatterplot you can observe a wide range of colors. Each color represents 
        a specific genre. The colors are bright and easy to see while not overpowering with saturation.  </p>

      <p>At first glance we can see that most of the data points are clustered in a small area. With the use of the 
        checkboxes, we can single out a specific genre, or compare two or more against each other. When using the checkboxes, 
        the scale will automatically shift to fit the current data checked, zooming in closer or zooming out. </p>
